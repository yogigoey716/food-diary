    recipeName: "Beef and Mustard Pie",
    recipeInstructions:
      "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.\r\nToss the beef and flour together in a bowl with some salt and black pepper.\r\nHeat a large casserole until hot, add half of the rapeseed oil and enough of the beef to just cover the bottom of the casserole.\r\nFry until browned on each side, then remove and set aside. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef.\r\nReturn the beef to the pan, add the wine and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the stock, onion, carrots, thyme and mustard, and season well with salt and pepper.\r\nCover with a lid and place in the oven for two hours.\r\nRemove from the oven, check the seasoning and set aside to cool. Remove the thyme.\r\nWhen the beef is cool and you're ready to assemble the pie, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.\r\nTransfer the beef to a pie dish, brush the rim with the beaten egg yolks and lay the pastry over the top. Brush the top of the pastry with more beaten egg.\r\nTrim the pastry so there is just enough excess to crimp the edges, then place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through.\r\nFor the green beans, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the beans and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender.\r\nDrain and toss with the butter, then season with black pepper.\r\nTo serve, place a large spoonful of pie onto each plate with some green beans alongside.",

    recipeName: "Beef Bourguignon",
    recipeInstructions:
      "Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. Season the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned.\r\nIn the same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onions, mushrooms, garlic and bouquet garni until lightly browned. Mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring into the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through.\r\nPour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour.\r\nHeat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Then cook for 3 hrs. If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan.\r\nTo make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the rosemary, thyme, bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins.\r\nAfter 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.",

Toss 1 kg of chicken wings with salt, pepper, and 1 teaspoon of baking powder for extra crispiness, then arrange them in a single layer on the rack. Bake for about 40-45 minutes, turning halfway, until golden and crispy. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and whisk in 1/2 cup of hot sauce (like Frank's RedHot) and 1 tablespoon of vinegar. Once the wings are done, toss them in the Buffalo sauce until well coated. Serve hot with celery sticks and blue cheese or ranch dressing for dipping.",
